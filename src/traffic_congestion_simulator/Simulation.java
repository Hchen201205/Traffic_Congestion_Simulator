 * Simulation class will be the class taking care of the simulation of the
 * program. It will utilize Road class and Light class because a traffic is
 * essentially formed by roads and lights. It will perform the simulation when a
 * run method is called. It will act as a thread for the control class. Because
 * of this, it will have a run() function so that it can be considered as a
 * Runnable. The reason for making this a thread class is that the control class
 * can then perform control experiment.
 * This class extends Thread class because it will be Thread and can be paused whenever the user wants to see an instance of simulation.
 * The reason why this class does not implement Runnable is because Runnable does not have pause and resume method. It only has ready and running state.
 * However, it will implement all the lights as Runnable.
 * Eventually, whenever the stop method of Thread class of a Simulation object is called, this instance will be terminated.
